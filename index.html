    <h1>Who is your ancestral spirit?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: small;">Your year pillar in bazi represents your most distant ancestors. This calculator gives a little portrait of your ancestral context based on your year pillar and should be used for entertainment purposes only. Only a full analysis of your bazi chart using all four pillars and timing will give a full picture of the ancestral influences working in your life.<br><br>Note: the new year starts on lichun solar term each year. If you were born during January or February, check to see if you were born before or after lichun solar term (typically celebrated on Lunar New Year but doesn't always correlate) to know which year you were born.</p>
